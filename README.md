this is just me playing with some data on boutique blurays I've been scraping. Thus far the sites included are just criterion and criterionReviews, but I intend to eventually add arrow to the mix too, just havent got round to it just yet. 

I intend for each bluray company to get its own notebook but again, for now its only criterion. I may also look to combine multiples into a single dataset for analysis later too.

Right now I'm doing some very rudimentary NLP on the blurb of the movies, in order to get a feel for genre. no idea if it will even slightly work though lol.
