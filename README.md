# movie_eda

repo for eda into webscraped movie data of various types. data included:
- criterion collection website data

for now its all in master branch because i didnt realise there was 'main' in gitlab rather than master somehow lol. ill pull it through when its in a decent state.

my targets are:
- do some cleaning
- plot some basic graphs to get a feel for the data
- use some NLP techniques on things such as the 'blurb' column, potentially to find genre as an initial idea, but could do a bunch of things with it really
- try to find a way of linking films from multipacks into their spine numbered multipack

since this will all have been done on home scraped data it'll be quite a cool little project i think
