this is just me playing with some data i scraped from criterion's website. i hope to use it as a means to learn some NLP methods, but so far all it is is cleaning and feature creation.

I've tried to keep each notebook relatively separate in ideas but we'll see how that works out. might just move them all into a single notebook if things don't go smoothly haha.

index:

    01 - setup_and_initial_feature_engineering: this notebook reads in the raw json data, cleans some inaccuracies out, converts a few of the dtypes and then adds a few new variables where neccessary. I will continue to update this with any new variables added as they come up
    02 - initial_eda: this notebook reads in the data created in 01, and then plot a bunch of poxy graphs with it. often what is plotted will dictate edits to 01, making me feel that these should really just be the same file but ack well, we'll see how it rolls i guess.
    

in future there will be all manner of sick stuff in this project for sure. jk itll be very low level but at least therel be some code
