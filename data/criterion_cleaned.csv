The documentaries collected here cast a cinematic eye on some of the most iconic moments in the history of modern sports, spotlighting athletes who embody the Olympic motto of ""Faster, Higher, Stronger"": Jesse Owens shattering world records on the track in 1936 Berlin, Jean-Claude Killy dominating the Grenoble slopes in 1968, Joan Benoit breaking away to win the Games' first women's marathon in Los Angeles in 1984. In addition to the impressive ten-feature contribution of Bud Greenspan, this stirring collective chronicle of triumph and defeat includes such documentary landmarks as Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia and Kon Ichikawa's Tokyo Olympiad, along with captivating lesser-known works by major directors like Claude Lelouch, Carlos Saura, and Milos Forman. It also offers a fascinating glimpse of the development of film itself, and of the technological progress that has brought viewers ever closer to the action.

In a rubble-strewn surveillance state where an endless overseas war props up the repressive regime of the all-seeing Big Brother, and all dissent is promptly squashed, a profoundly alienated citizen, Winston Smith (thrillingly played by John Hurt), risks everything for an illicit affair with the rebellious Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), defiantly asserting his humanity in the face of soul-crushing conformity.

Set in the cloistered world of nineteenth-century kabuki theater, the film charts a female impersonator's attempts to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were driven to insanity and suicide by a trio of corrupt men. Ichikawa takes the conventions of melodrama and turns them on their head, bringing the hero's fractured psyche to life in boldly experimental widescreen compositions infused with kaleidoscopic color, pop-art influences, and meticulous choreography.

,,185.0,The Adventures of Antoine Doinel,https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/346-the-adventures-of-antoine-doinel,,,"The release of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows in 1959 shook world cinema to its foundations. The now-classic portrait of troubled adolescence introduced a major new director in the cinematic landscape and was an inaugural gesture of the revolutionary French New Wave. But The 400 Blows did not only introduce the world to its precocious director--it also unveiled his indelible creation: Antoine Doinel. Initially patterned closely after Truffaut himself, the Doinel character (played by the irrepressible and iconic Jean-Pierre Leaud) reappeared in four subsequent films that knowingly portrayed his myriad frustrations and romantic entanglements from his stormy teens through marriage, children, divorce, and adulthood. With The Adventures of Antoine Doinel, Criterion is proud to present Truffaut's celebrated saga in its entirety: the feature films The 400 Blows, Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board, and Love on the Run, and the 1962 short subject, Antoine and Colette, in a special edition five-disc box set.",,,,"Love on the Run, Bed and Board, Stolen Kisses, The 400 Blows",DVD,,,"New digital transfers of all films, enhanced for widescreen televisions, Truffaut's early short film, Les mistons, Audio commentary for Les mistons by assistant director and future co-writer Claude de Givray, Audio/visual ""primer"" for Les mistons by film historian Serge Toubiana, Working with Francois Truffaut: Claude de Givray and Bernard Revon, An exclusive re-edited version of a 1986 interview with Truffaut co-writers Claude de Givray and Bernard Revon, originally conducted for Rainer Gansera's documentary Arbeiten mit Francois Truffaut, Excerpt from the rare documentary Francois Truffaut (1961) featuring Truffaut discussing his influences and beginnings, along with Les mistons and The 400 Blows, Interview from the 1981 French TV show Champ contre champ in which Truffaut discusses Jean-Pierre Leaud, and the challenges of creating films that are intensely personal, yet popular in appeal, Promotional art gallery for The 400 Blows, Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board and Love on the Run, Two audio commentaries for The 400 Blows: one by cinema professor Brian Stonehill and another by lifelong friend of Truffaut, Robert Lachenay, Rare audition footage of The 400 Blows stars Jean-Pierre Leaud, Patrick Auffay and Richard Kanayan, Newsreel footage of Jean-Pierre Leaud in Cannes for the showing of The 400 Blows, Excerpt from a French TV program with Truffaut discussing his youth, critical writings, and the origins of Antoine Doinel in The 400 Blows and Antoine and Colette, Television interview with Truffaut about the global financial reception of The 400 Blows and his own critical impression of the film, Theatrical trailers for The 400 Blows, Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board, and Love on the Run, Introduction to Stolen Kisses by film historian Serge Toubiana, Excerpt from the TV show Cineastes de notre temps: Francois Truffaut, dix ans, dix films in which Truffaut discusses his vision of the Doinel cycle, and the complex relationship between Doinel and actor Jean-Pierre Leaud, Archival newsreel footage of the ""Langlois Affair,"" documenting protests by Truffaut and other French film industry luminaries against the removal of Cinematheque francaise director Henri Langlois, Promotional spot featuring Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut appealing for public support of Henri Langlois, Newsreel footage of Truffaut's impassioned rally to shut down the 1968 Cannes Film Festival in support of striking students and workers, Rare behind-the-scenes footage with Truffaut at work on the Bed and Board set, and being interviewed along with actress Claude Jade, Rare television interview with Jean-Pierre Leaud discussing his feelings about Truffaut and Antoine Doinel, and his thoughts about ""ending"" the series, Excerpt from the 1972 documentary Approches du cinema: Francois Truffaut ou la nouvelle vague, in which Truffaut addresses the complexities of Antoine Doinel, Rare television interview excerpt of Truffaut and actress/co-writer Marie-France Pisier discussing their working styles and their feelings about Love on the Run, Excerpt from the 1980 TV show Cinescope in which Truffaut addresses his misgivings about his finale to the Doinel series, and illuminates his feelings about Jean-Pierre Leaud and Antoine Doinel, New and improved subtitle translation for all films",,1,0,0,1,,,0,

With intense performances and hauntingly powerful scenes and images, Blue Velvet is an unforgettable vision of innocence lost, and one of the most influential American films of the past few decades.","Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern, Hope Lange, Dean Stockwell, George Dickerson, Priscilla Pointer, Frances Bay, Jack Harvey, Ken Stovitz, Brad Dourif, Jack Nance, J.

Only Collins's dreams of escape keep him going, but how can he possibly bust out of Munsey's chains?

In the wake of this success, director Wim Wenders filmed the ensemble's members--including golden-voiced Ibrahim Ferrer and piano virtuoso Ruben Gonzalez--in a series of illuminating interviews and live performances.

There, he is struck by a vision of pure beauty in the form of a young boy named Tadzio (Bjorn Andresen), his infatuation developing into an obsession even as rumors of a plague spread through the city.

The Forgiveness of Blood is a tense and perceptive depiction of a place where tradition and progress coexist uneasily, as well as a dynamic coming-of-age drama.","Tristan Halilaj, Refet Abazi, Zana Hasaj, Erjon Mani, Luan Jaha, Cun Lajci, Veton Osmani, Selman Lokaj, Kol Zefi, Sindi Lacej, Ilire Vinca Celaj, Esmeralda Gjonlulaj, Elsajed Tallalli, Ibrahim Ymeri, Servete Haxhija, Arlind Lleshi, Alfred Lisi, Edmond Pepkolaj, Geg Zefi, Pjeter Noshi, Gjon Lula, Isuf Duraj, Sabri Haxhija, Xhevdet Shima, Gjin Basha, Arben Buhaj, Fatmir Shabaj",Color,Director Joshua Marston Written by Joshua Marston Written by Andamion Murataj Produced by Paul Mezey Executive producer Janine Gold Executive producers Eric Abraham Executive producers Domenico Procacci Executive producers Hunter Gray Executive producers Tyler Brodie Coproducers Andamion Murataj Coproducers Gwen Bialic Associate producer Andrew Goldman Director of photography Rob Hardy Production design Tommaso Ortino Editor Malcolm Jamieson Music Jacobo Lieberman Music Leonardo Heiblum Costume designer Emir Turkeshi Set photography Anila Jaho,The Forgiveness of Blood,"Blu-Ray, DVD",Albanian,109.0,"New high-definition digital transfer, approved by director of photography Rob Hardy, with 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition, Audio commentary by director and cowriter Joshua Marston, Two new video programs: Acting Close to Home, a discussion between Marston and actors Refet Abazi, Tristan Halilaj, and Sindi Lacej, and Truth on the Ground, featuring new and on-set interviews with producer Paul Mezey, Abazi, Halilaj, and Lacej, Audition and rehearsal footage, Trailer, PLUS: A booklet featuring a new essay by film writer Oscar Moralde , New high-definition digital transfer, approved by director of photography Rob Hardy, with 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition, Audio commentary by director and cowriter Joshua Marston, Two new video programs: Acting Close to Home, a discussion between Marston and actors Refet Abazi, Tristan Halilaj, and Sindi Lacej, and Truth on the Ground, featuring new and on-set interviews with producer Paul Mezey, Abazi, Halilaj, and Lacej, Audition and rehearsal footage, Trailer, PLUS: A booklet featuring a new essay by film writer Oscar Moralde",2010.0,1,1,0,0,,1.0,0,North America

By turns playful, philosophical, and subtly political, The Gleaners and I is a warmly human reflection on the contradictions of our consumerist world from an artist who, like her subjects, finds unexpected richness where few think to look.","Director, Written by, Cinematography by, Cinematography by, Cinematography by, Cinematography by, Cinematography by, Edited by, Edited by, Music by, Music by, Music by, Music by, Rap by",Color,,The Gleaners and I,,French,82.0,,2000.0,0,0,0,0,,0.0,0,Europe

United States,,495.0,The Golden Age of Television,https://www.criterion.com/films/3560-the-golden-age-of-television,,1.33:1,"The hugely popular live American television plays of the 1950s have become the stuff of legend. Combining elements of theater, radio, and filmmaking, they were produced at a moment when TV technology was growing more mobile and art was being made accessible to a newly suburban postwar demographic. These astonishingly choreographed, brilliantly acted, and socially progressive ""teleplays"" constituted an artistic high for the medium, bringing Broadway-quality drama to all of America. The award-winning programs included in this box set--originally curated for PBS in the early 1980s as the series The Golden Age of Television, featuring recollections from key cast and crew members--were conceived by such up-and-comers as Rod Serling and John Frankenheimer and star the likes of Paul Newman, Mickey Rooney, Rod Steiger, Julie Harris, and Piper Laurie. Marty Renowned dramatist Paddy Chayefsky's poignant and touching character study of a lonely, middle-aged butcher (Rod Steiger) looking for love helped usher in the naturalistic style of television drama in the 1950s. Marty, directed by Delbert Mann, remains an enduring classic of the age of live television. Patterns Nothing less than a milestone in television drama, writer Rod Serling's Patterns examines a power struggle between a corporate boss (Everett Sloane), a washed-up company man (Ed Begley), and the young executive groomed to take his place (Richard Kiley). A huge hit when first broadcast, the production was re-aired the following week, which was unprecedented at the time. No Time for Sergeants Andy Griffith makes his first television appearance as Will Stockdale, a bumptious Air Force draftee who manages to drive his sergeant (Harry King) and the jokers who share his barracks crazy. No Time for Sergeants is a riotous military comedy and launched newcomer Griffith to stardom. A Wind from the South Julie Harris stars as Shivawn, an Irish country innkeeper who finds new meaning in her life when she finally experiences her first love, with a troubled tourist (Donald Woods). Written by playwright James Costigan, A Wind from the South features a typically marvelous performance from Harris and a surprising turn from Merv Griffin, who sings the show's theme song. Requiem for a Heavyweight A punch-drunk prizefighter (Jack Palance) is forced to face life outside the ring in Rod Serling's searing indictment of the professional boxing underworld. Costarring father and son Ed and Keenan Wynn, the former in his dramatic debut, and directed by Ralph Nelson, the Emmy Award-winning Requiem for a Heavyweight is a moving portrait of a would-be champion. Bang the Drum Slowly Paul Newman is the star pitcher of a professional baseball team who helps a terminally ill country bumpkin catcher (Albert Salmi) live out one last season on the diamond. A touching and honest tale of friendship, Bang the Drum Slowly is also considered one of the finest baseball stories of all time. The Comedian Mickey Rooney stars as a raging, tyrannical TV star stepping on anyone on his way to the top, including his browbeaten brother (Mel Torme), despairing wife (Kim Hunter), and washed-up scriptwriter (Edmond O'Brien). Powerfully directed by John Frankenheimer from a script adapted for the screen by Rod Serling, The Comedian is a volatile glimpse behind the showbiz curtain.

An intimate story of loyalty and betrayal writ large across the epic canvas of mid-twentieth-century American history, The Irishman (based on the real-life Sheeran's confessions, as told to writer Charles Brandt for the book I Heard You Paint Houses) is a uniquely reflective late-career triumph that balances its director's virtuoso set pieces with a profoundly personal rumination on aging, mortality, and the decisions and regrets that shape a life.","Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano, Bobby Cannavale, Anna Paquin, Stephen Graham, Stephanie Kurtzuba, Jack Huston, Kathrine Narducci, Jesse Plemons, Domenick Lombardozzi, Paul Herman, Gary Basaraba, Marin Ireland, Lucy Gallina, Jonathan Morris, Dascha Polanco, Welker White, Louis Cancelmi, Bo Dietl, Sebastian Maniscalco, Aleksa Palladino, Steven Van Zandt, Jim Norton",Color,Director Martin Scorsese Screenplay by Steven Zaillian Based upon the book by Charles Brandt Produced by Martin Scorsese Produced by Robert De Niro Produced by Jane Rosenthal Produced by Emma Tillinger Koskoff Produced by Irwin Winkler Produced by Gerald Chamale Produced by Gaston Pavlovich Produced by Randall Emmett Produced by Gabriele Israilovici Executive producer Rick Yorn Executive producer Richard Baratta Executive producer Berry Welsh Executive producer Niels Juul Executive producer George Furla Executive producer Nicholas Pileggi Executive producer Jai Stefan Executive producer Tyler Zacharia Executive producer Chad A.

He did this by assembling an amazing team--including such eventual nonfiction luminaries as Richard Leacock, D. A. Pennebaker, and Albert Maysles--that would transform documentary cinema. In 1960, the group was granted direct access to John F. Kennedy, filming him on the campaign trail and eventually in the Oval Office. This resulted in three films of remarkable, behind-closed-doors intimacy--Primary, Adventures on the New Frontier, and Crisis--and, following the president's assassination, the poetic short Faces of November.

Brooding and romantic, Rio is the last and perhaps the most tender of the iconic outsiders that the great actor imbued with such intensity throughout his career.","Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens, Pina Pellicer, Larry Duran, Sam Gilman, MIriam Colon, Timothy Carey, Margarita Cordova, Elisha Cook Jr., Rodolfo Acosta, Joan Petrone, Joe Dominguez, Tom Webb, Ray Teal, John Dierkes, Philip Ahn, Hank Worden, Clem Harvey, William Forrest, Mina Martinez",Color,Director Marlon Brando Producer Frank P.

It is also perhaps her unlikeliest project: a star-studded comic fantasy with an extravagant sense of style and an adoring but slightly off-kilter perspective on the magic of filmmaking. French New Wave icon Michel Piccoli is a mysterious aging impresario named Simon Cinema who has hired a young film student, Camille (Julie Gayet), to simply sit with him at his mansion and talk about movies. Skeptical yet increasingly enchanted, Camille bears witness to cinema itself coming to life, allowing Varda to wittily integrate a mind-boggling parade of appearances by screen legends (Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anouk Aimee, Robert De Niro, and many others), and attest to the vigorous health of the movies at the close of the twentieth century.","Michel Piccoli, Marcello Mastroianni, Henri Garcin, Julie Gayet, Mathieu Demy, Emmanuel Salinger, Anouk Aimee, Fanny Ardant, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Romane Bohringer, Sandrine Bonnaire, Jean-Claude Brialy, Patrick Bruel, Alain Delon, Catherine Deneuve, Robert De Niro, Gerard Depardieu, Harrison Ford, Gina Lollobrigida, Jeanne Moreau, Hanna Schygulla",Color,Director Agnes Varda Screenplay by Agnes Varda Cinematography by Eric Gautier Sound Henri Morelle Sound Jean-Pierre Duret Edited by Hugues Darmois Music by Maurice Jarre Music by Michel Legrand Music by Nino Rota Music by Michel Colombier Set design by Cyr Boitard Set design by Cedric Simoneau Costumes by Rosalie Varda First assistant Didier Rouget,One Hundred and One Nights,,French,104.0,,1990.0,0,0,0,0,,0.0,0,Europe

The Parallax View's coolly stylized, shadow-etched compositions by acclaimed cinematographer Gordon Willis give visual expression to a mood that begins as an anxious whisper and ends as a scream into the void.","Warren Beatty, Hume Cronyn, William Daniels, Paula Prentiss, Walter McGinn",Color,Director Alan J.

A dreamlike adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel, the film stars the enchanting Joan Fontaine as a young woman who believes she has found her heart's desire when she marries the dashing aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter (played with cunning vulnerability by Laurence Olivier). But upon moving to Manderley--her groom's baroque ancestral mansion--she soon learns that his deceased wife haunts not only the estate but the temperamental, brooding Maxim as well.

The political and cultural tumult of the early 1960s shook Japan as it did the rest of the world. Japanese filmmakers responded to the changing times by disguising themes of dissent in the traditional form of the swordplay film, or chanbara. Previously populated by heroic samurai, self-sacrificing ronin, and historical figures who exemplified noble Japanese virtues, the genre began embracing a new kind of hero, or antihero: the lone outcast, distrustful of authority but maintaining a personal code of honor.

Coupling earthy sensuality with kaleidoscopically stylized images, Russell pursues this quartet to the heights of agony and ecstasy, crafting a breathtaking drama of human sexuality at its most liberating, dominating, and destructive extremes.","Alan Bates, Oliver Reed, Glenda Jackson, Jennie Linden, Eleanor Bron, Alan Webb, Catherine Willmer, Vladek Sheybal",Color,Director Ken Russell Adapted from the novel by D.
